        <p>
            This page explains how Livo handles privacy. Livo is a personal IPTV player that lets you
            play your own M3U and Xtream Codes playlists on your device. The app does not provide
            IPTV content, channels, or subscriptions, and it never shares your playlists with third
            parties.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Collected Data</h2>
        <p>
            Livo does not collect personal identifiers such as names or email addresses. The app may
            rely on third-party services that gather anonymous device and usage data to keep track of
            performance and stability.
        </p>
        <p>Livo may integrate:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Firebase Analytics for usage statistics and screen events.</li>
            <li>Firebase Crashlytics for crash reports and anonymous device identifiers.</li>
            <li>Google AdMob for ad impressions, clicks, and device ad IDs (IDFA/AAID).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Purpose of Processing</h2>
        <p>
            The collected anonymous data helps us understand feature usage, monitor crashes, and
            improve the app experience while keeping the app lightweight and secure.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>
            Livo developers do not sell or rent user information to third parties. Third-party
            services (Firebase, AdMob) process anonymous data according to their own privacy policies.
        </p>

        <h2>4. App Tracking Transparency</h2>
        <p>
            On iOS 14.5 and later, Apple’s ATT framework requires user permission before collecting
            advertising identifiers or tracking across apps. Users can grant or revoke this
            permission at any time from system settings.
        </p>

        <h2>5. IPTV Content</h2>
        <p>
            Livo hosts no IPTV content, offers no channels, and does not store playlists or stream
            details on its servers. All content is provided directly by the user, and the user is fully
            responsible for the content they add.
